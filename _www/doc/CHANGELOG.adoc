[#v0_6_0]
== gorankusu v0.6.0 (2024-03-05)

[#v0_6_0__breaking_changes]
=== Breaking changes

target: changes Opts to non-pointer::
+
--
Previously, we use pointer to indicated that the Target can be attacked
or not.
Since HTTPTarget now have AllowAttack, this options can be changes to
non-pointer.
--


all: change the signature of default request/response dumper::
+
--
Instead of function that use the signature of HTTPRequestDumper/
HTTPResponseDumper; change it to function that _return_ HTTPRequestDumper/
HTTPResponseDumper.
In this way, the documentation can show the clear relation between
function and its type.
--


[#v0_6_0__new_features]
=== New features

all: add global HTTP headers for Target::
+
--
The Headers field on Target define the global headers that will be send
along with all HTTPTarget or WebSocketTarget.
The same header can also be defined on HTTPTarget that override the
value of Target.
--


all: add default HTTPRunHandler::
+
--
Previously, the default HTTPRunHandler is hidden, called dynamically
based on Run is nil or not.
This changes make it exported as function that return HTTPRunHandler
to show how define and create a custom HTTPRunHandler.
--


all: add default HTTPParamsConverter for [HTTPTarget.ParamsConverter]::
+
--
The DefaultParamsConverter define default function to convert
[HTTPTarget.Params] to its equivalent parameters in HTTP, either as query
in URL or as bytes in body.

This changes introduce breaking changes in HTTPTarget where field
ConvertParams renamed to ParamsConverter.
--


all: set default HTTPTarget Attack if its not set::
+
--
Previously, the function for Attack need to be coded manually.

This changes introduce new function DefaultHTTPAttack that generate
HTTPAttackHandler based on the HTTPTarget method, request type, and
Params; if AllowAttack is true and Attack is nil.
--


[#v0_6_0__bug_fixes]
=== Bug fixes

all: fix null navigation links::
+
--
If the navLinks fields is empty, the HTTP API will return "null" and cause
the rendering error.
This changes fix this issue by allocating the slice navLinks with one
capabilities to make JSON always return "[]" if its empty.
--


[#v0_5_0]
== gorankusu v0.5.0 (2024-02-08)

This release rename the project from "trunks" to "gorankusu".

The original idea of "trunks" is because the core library that we
use for load testing is named
https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/["vegeta"]
(from Dragon Ball), and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegeta[Vegeta]
has a son named Trunks.
In English, trunks also have multiple meanings.

In order to have a unique name, we rename the project to "gorankusu",
which is a combination of "go" (the main programming language
that built the application) and "torankusu" the Hepburn of "Trunks".


[#v0_5_0__breaking_changes]
=== Breaking changes

In order for making the code consistent and conform with linters, some
exported types, fields, methods, and functions has been renamed.

* In AttackResult type, field HttpTargetID renamed to HTTPTargetID
* HttpConvertParams renamed to HTTPConvertParams
* HttpRunHandler renamed to HTTPRunHandler
* HttpAttackHandler renamed to HTTPAttackHandler
* HttpPreAttackHandler renamed to HTTPPreAttackHandler
* HttpTarget renamed to HTTPTarget

and many more.

[#v0_5_0__new_features]
=== New features

all: allow submit free form request body in HTTPTarget::

The field RawBody can be filled by anything by user.
Those field can be activated by setting WithRawBody.

Implements: https://todo.sr.ht/~shulhan/trunks/1
--


all: add type to customize how to dump HTTP request and response::
+
--
The HTTPRequestDumper define an handler to convert [http.Request] into
[RunResponse] DumpRequest.
The HTTPResponseDumper define an handler to convert [http.Response]
into [RunResponse] DumpResponse.

In HTTPTarget we add fields RequestDumper and ResponseDumper that if its not
nil it will be used to dump HTTP request and response to raw bytes.
--


all: support parameter binding in HTTP Path::
+
If HTTP Path contains key, for example "/:book", and the Params contains
the same key, the Path will be filled with value from Params.
The same key in Params will be deleted and not send on query parameter
or body.
